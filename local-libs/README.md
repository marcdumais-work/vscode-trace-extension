# Local Libraries (`local-libs`)

This folder contains libraries included as `git subtrees`, each in its own subfolder. Subtrees allow us to develop and version external libraries *in-source*, while still maintaining a connection to their upstream Git repositories. This setup simplifies development across multiple tightly-coupled packages.

Currently, we include the Trace Viewer libraries (`traceviewer-base` and `traceviewer-react-components`) from the [`theia-trace-extension`](https://github.com/eclipse-cdt-cloud/theia-trace-extension) repository.

## ðŸ’¡ Motivation: Local Development with Upstream Sync

Maintaining the Trace Viewer for VSCode extension often requires coordinated changes across multiple interdependent libraries. These librariesâ€”originally developed and maintained in separate repositories under the [Eclipse CDT Cloud](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/iot.cdt-cloud) projectâ€”are published and consumed via npm:

- `tsp-typescript-client`
- `timeline-chart`
- `traceviewer-base`
- `traceviewer-react-components`

The traditional development flowâ€”fork, PR, review, publish, version bump, consumeâ€”must be repeated *per library*, often across multiple layers of the dependency chain. This is time-consuming, fragile, and discourages rapid iteration or experimentation.

### ðŸš€ A Better Tradeoff

By importing key libraries as **git subtrees** into this repository:

- ðŸ”§ Contributors can **develop and test** changes across the VSCode extension *and* its dependent libraries as if everything were part of a single codebase.
- ðŸ“¤ Maintainers can **upstream improvements** made to subtree libraries via `git subtree push`, preserving history and authorship.
- ðŸ“¥ Maintainers can **pull in updates** from upstream libraries at any time using `git subtree pull`, keeping the local copies up to date.

This approach strikes a **pragmatic balance**:
- Local development is fast, unified, and testable.
- Contribution and collaboration with upstream library repos remain fully possible.
- Gitâ€™s native subtree support ensures traceability and minimizes manual synchronization work.

## ðŸ“¦ Included Subtree: `traceviewer-libs`

This subtree includes the following two libraries from `theia-trace-extension`, originally located under its `packages/` directory:

- `traceviewer-base`
- `traceviewer-react-components`

Local location:

- `local-libs/traceviewer-libs`

For more information about that subtree, see README.MD under the folder above.
